# Sample Post with Code

This post demonstrates how code blocks are rendered in this blog.

## JavaScript Example

Here is a simple JavaScript code block with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Python Example

And here is a Python example.

```python
def greet(name):
  return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

That's it! You can add any code block and it will be highlighted.
