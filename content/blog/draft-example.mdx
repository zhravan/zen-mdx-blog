# This is a Draft Post

**Note:** This post is marked as `draft: true` in the frontmatter.

## What Happens with Drafts?

When a post is marked as draft:

1. **In Development:**
   - Visible if `showInList: true` in config
   - Shows draft badge
   - Full access for testing

2. **In Production:**
   - Hidden from all lists
   - Not included in sitemap
   - Requires preview token to access
   - Returns 404 if accessed directly

## Testing the Draft System

This post demonstrates:

- Draft badge component
- Filtering in post lists
- Preview mode with token
- Development visibility

## Preview URL

In production, you can preview this with:

```
https://yoursite.com/blog/draft-example?preview=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
```

## Draft Content

This is where you'd write content that's not ready for publication yet:

- [ ] Finish research
- [ ] Add code examples
- [ ] Get peer review
- [ ] Final proofread

## Configuration

The drafts plugin is configured in `config/plugins.yaml`:

```yaml
drafts:
  enabled: true
  showInList: false       # Show in dev mode
  previewToken: "secret"  # For production preview
```

## When to Use Drafts

Use draft posts when:

- Content is incomplete
- Needs review or fact-checking
- Scheduled for future publication
- Testing new features

## Publishing

To publish this post, simply:

1. Remove `draft: true` from frontmatter
2. Update the date
3. Rebuild the site
